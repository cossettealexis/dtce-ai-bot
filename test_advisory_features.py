Test the enhanced advisory system with all 7 features:
1. Include superseded folder if user asks for it
2. Provide engineering advice/summarize findings vs just links
3. Give warnings where clients are upset about something
4. Give more advisory answers
5. Add general guidelines to all questions  
6. Combine suitefiles/general knowledge/NZ standards
7. Add lessons learned and analyze info to provide advice on what to do/not do
