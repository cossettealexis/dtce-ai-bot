**Lessons Learned:**
â€¢ Always specify pre-installation test piles in suspect soils
â€¢ Require continuous soil logging during pile installation
â€¢ Use dynamic load testing rather than relying on torque correlation
â€¢ Include 25% contingency for pile length in soft soil areas

**Current Best Practice:**

"Precast vs in-situ concrete for floor slabs - DTCE decision analysis:

**Decision Matrix Projects:**

**Precast Concrete Selected:**
â€¢ **Job #2023-067:** 4-storey office building - Wellington CBD
  - **Rationale:** Accelerated construction schedule (client requirement)
  - **Cost comparison:** Precast 15% higher material cost, 30% faster construction
  - **Technical factors:** 200mm hollowcore + 75mm topping, 8m spans
  - **Performance:** Excellent - no deflection issues, acoustic performance good

â€¢ **Job #2022-134:** Multi-unit residential - Petone
  - **Rationale:** Repetitive floor plates, noise control between units
  - **Challenges:** Crane access restricted, required smaller panel sizes
  - **Outcome:** Construction time reduced by 6 weeks vs in-situ alternative

**In-Situ Concrete Selected:**
â€¢ **Job #2023-089:** Irregular geometry office - Newtown
  - **Rationale:** Non-standard spans (5.2m Ã— 8.7m), complex penetrations
  - **Cost comparison:** In-situ 20% lower total cost (including formwork)
  - **Technical factors:** Post-tensioned flat slab, architectural exposed finish

**Comparative Performance Data:**
| Aspect | Precast | In-Situ |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Speed | 40% faster | Standard |
| Cost | +10-15% | Baseline |
| Quality | Consistent | Variable |
| Flexibility | Limited | High |
| Acoustic | Excellent | Good |

**Decision Criteria Developed:**
â€¢ **Choose Precast when:** Repetitive spans, accelerated program, acoustic critical
â€¢ **Choose In-Situ when:** Irregular geometry, complex services, architectural finish
â€¢ **Cost breakeven:** Typically 8+ repetitive bays for precast to be economical

**Long-term Performance:**
â€¢ Precast: No structural issues in 12 completed projects (2020-2024)
â€¢ In-situ: 2 minor cracking issues in post-tensioned slabs (remediated)
