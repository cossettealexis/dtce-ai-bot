    # FAQ's - Complex RFP Analysis (from QUESTIONS.TXT)
    "Heres the request for a fee proposal from an architect. Can you find me past DTCE projects that had similar scope to this? It looks like a double cantilever corner window. We're after a proposal for some SED structure required for a residential renovation in Seatoun. Likely scope would be for posts and beams supporting roof above a new sliding door corner unit at first floor level. This would be supported by concrete wall structure (and a concrete beam below).",
    
    # FAQ's - Administrative/Process Queries (from QUESTIONS.TXT)
    "I'm trying to enter a quote into workflowmax but the engineer hasn't given me any times to enter, just the overall cost. What should I do?"
