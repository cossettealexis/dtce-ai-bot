Objective: Knowledge-based AI for DTCE

INPUT: Ask about a specific clause/code that talks about a particular “term” and its requirement that can be found on NZ standard.
* “Please tell me the minimum clear cover requirements as per NZS code in designing a concrete element.”
* “Tell me what particular clause talks about the detailing requirements in designing a beam.”
* “Tell me the strength reduction factors used when I’m designing a beam or when considering seismic actions.”
* “Tell me what particular NZS structural code to refer to if I’m designing a composite slab to make it a floor diaphragm?”
OUTPUT:AI to give an accurate response that was directly obtained from the NZ Standard (if uploaded to the AI database).

INPUT: Look for past projects as references using “keywords” or structural detailing
* “I am designing a precast panel, please tell me all past projects that have a scope about the following keywords or description:Precast PanelPrecastPrecast ConnectionUnispans”
* “I am designing a timber retaining wall, it’s going to be 3m tall; can you provide me example past projects and help me draft a design philosophy?”
* “Please advise me on what DTCE has done in the past for a 2-storey concrete precast panel building maybe with a timber-framed structure on top?”
OUTPUT:AI is expected to provide job numbers that include the keywords from the user. AI may also directly provide links that will lead the user to the specific folder in SuiteFiles.

INPUT: I’m looking for a specific proprietary product that’s suitable to provide a waterproofing layer to a concrete block wall that DTCE has used in the past.
* “I need timber connection details for joining a timber beam to a column. Please provide specifications for the proprietary products DTCE usually refers to, as well as other options to consider.”
* “What are the available sizes of LVL timber on the market? Please list all links containing the sizes and price per length. Also, confirm if the suppliers are located near Wellington.”
OUTPUT:AI to provide relevant product specifications, prioritizing documents from SuiteFiles, along with alternative products found online. AI may also include product links to make access easier for the user.

INPUT: Look for online threads or references about structural design procedures or current design discussions accessible to the public (especially NZ references / forums)
* “I am currently designing a composite beam but need to make it haunched/tapered. Please provide related references or online threads mentioning the keyword ‘tapered composite beam’, preferably from anonymous structural engineers.”
* “Please provide design guidelines for a reinforced concrete column to withstand both seismic and gravity actions. If possible, include a legitimate link that gives direct access to the specific design guidelines.”
OUTPUT:AI to search for and provide links to relevant public online discussions, technical forums, or reference articles that match the keywords. Where possible, AI should prioritize reputable engineering communities and professional sources.

INPUT: My client is asking about builders that we’ve worked with before.Can you find any companies and/or contact details that constructed a design for us in the past 3 years and didn’t seem to have too many issues during construction?The design job I’m dealing with now is a steel structure retrofit of an old brick building.
OUTPUT:AI to search past project records or the DTCE database and return builder names, contact information, and related project references.

INPUT: Easier access to all general templates / design spreadsheets in SuiteFiles or any other NZ engineering body (e.g., PS1, PS1A to PS4 templates)
* "Please provide me with the template we generally use for preparing a PS1. Also, please provide me with the direct link to access it on SuiteFiles."
* "I wasn’t able to find a PS3 template in SuiteFiles. Please provide me with a legitimate link to a general PS3 template that can be submitted to any council in New Zealand."
* "Please provide me with the link or the file for the timber beam design spreadsheet that DTCE usually uses or has used."
OUTPUT:AI to provide specific documents/templates, reducing time spent searching the internet or past SuiteFiles records.

ADDITIONAL:DTCE database which has the builder/client contact details.

Other Questions Example:
Here’s the request for a fee proposal from an architect.Can you find me past DTCE projects that had similar scope to this?It looks like a double cantilever corner window.
“Hi Marlo,We’re after a proposal for some SED structure required for a residential renovation in Seatoun.Likely scope would be for posts and beams supporting roof above a new sliding door corner unit at first floor level.This would be supported by concrete wall structure (and a concrete beam below).
WIP preliminary drawings below, along with a couple of screenshots illustrating what we’re after.If you have capacity for this could you send us through a proposal that we can forward on to client.”

1. Scenario-Based Technical Queries
* "Show me examples of mid-rise timber frame buildings in high wind zones that we’ve designed."
* "What foundation systems have we used for houses on steep slopes in Wellington?"
* "Find projects where we designed concrete shear walls for seismic strengthening."
* "What connection details have we used for balconies on coastal apartment buildings?"

2. Problem-Solving & Lessons Learned
* "What issues have we run into when using screw piles in soft soils?"
* "Summarise any lessons learned from projects where retaining walls failed during construction."
* "What waterproofing methods have worked best for basement walls in high water table areas?"

3. Regulatory & Consent Precedents
* "Give me examples of projects where council questioned our wind load calculations."
* "How have we approached alternative solution applications for non-standard stair designs?"
* "Show me precedent for using non-standard bracing in heritage building retrofits."

4. Cost & Time Insights
* "How long does it typically take from concept to PS1 for small commercial alterations?"
* "What’s the typical cost range for structural design of multi-unit residential projects?"
* "Find projects where the structural scope expanded significantly after concept design."

5. Best Practices & Templates
* "What’s our standard approach to designing steel portal frames for industrial buildings?"
* "Show me our best example drawings for timber diaphragm design."
* "What calculation templates do we have for multi-storey timber buildings?"

6. Materials & Methods Comparisons
* "When have we chosen precast concrete over in-situ concrete for floor slabs, and why?"
* "What timber treatment levels have we specified for exterior beams in coastal conditions?"
* "Compare different seismic retrofit methods we’ve used for unreinforced masonry buildings."
