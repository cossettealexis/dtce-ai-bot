# URL Centralization Summary

## Problem Addressed
Previously, hardcoded URLs were scattered throughout the codebase, making maintenance difficult. If URLs needed to be changed, they would have to be found and updated in multiple files.

## Solution Implemented
Created a centralized URL configuration system with the following components:

### 1. Centralized Configuration (`dtce_ai_bot/config/settings.py`)
Added centralized URL settings:
```python
# Microsoft Graph API URLs (centralized configuration)
microsoft_graph_base_url: str = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0"
microsoft_login_authority_base: str = "https://login.microsoftonline.com"
microsoft_graph_scope: str = "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"

# Azure Search URL template (centralized configuration)
azure_search_base_url: str = "https://{service_name}.search.windows.net"
```

### 2. URL Builder Utility (`dtce_ai_bot/utils/graph_urls.py`)
Created a centralized URL builder class that:
- Provides methods for constructing all Microsoft Graph API URLs
- Provides methods for constructing Azure Search URLs
- Uses the centralized settings configuration
- Offers easy-to-use methods like `sites_url()`, `drive_file_content_url()`, etc.

### 3. Updated Client Code
Modified the following files to use centralized URLs:
- `dtce_ai_bot/integrations/microsoft_graph.py` - Now uses `graph_urls.graph_base_url()`
- `dtce_ai_bot/integrations/azure_search.py` - Now uses `settings.azure_search_base_url`
- `dtce_ai_bot/integrations/azure/search_client.py` - Now uses `self.settings.azure_search_base_url`

## Benefits
1. **Single Point of Change**: All URLs can now be modified in one place (`settings.py`)
2. **Environment-Specific Configuration**: URLs can be overridden via environment variables
3. **Type Safety**: URL construction is handled by typed methods in the URL builder
4. **Maintainability**: No more hunting for hardcoded URLs throughout the codebase
5. **Consistency**: All services use the same URL construction pattern

## Usage Examples
```python
# Before (hardcoded URLs everywhere)
url = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites"
endpoint = f"https://{service_name}.search.windows.net"

# After (centralized)
url = graph_urls.sites_url()
endpoint = urls.azure_search_endpoint(service_name)
```

## Future Extensibility
The URL builder pattern can be easily extended to include other service URLs like:
- Azure Blob Storage URLs
- Azure Form Recognizer URLs
- Any other external service endpoints

This centralization makes the codebase much more maintainable and reduces the risk of inconsistent URL updates.
