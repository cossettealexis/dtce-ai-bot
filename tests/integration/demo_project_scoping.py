DEMONSTRATION: How the new Project Scoping Analysis works in Teams
===============================================================

This shows exactly what happens when someone sends the marquee request in Teams.

# Example Teams conversation flow:

TEAMS_MESSAGE_INPUT = """
Hi Team,
Thanks again for all your help so far with the other PS1 and for supporting us through the current situation. It's been a frustrating process, especially considering how much we've paid for the renewal.

I now have another structure I need to get certified. This time, it's for a 15x40m double decker marquee that I'm 90% certain will be installed in Wellington. I'm just waiting on final sign-off from both the client and the supplier.

I've attached the drawing and have also asked the supplier for the current technical data. What I know so far:
The marquee is rated to withstand wind loads of up to 120kph, which is excellent for Trentham and even exceeds the threshold of their grandstand, which currently needs to be evacuated at 80kph.
The marquee will be installed on a concrete pad. We're open to your recommendation on fixing‚Äîbolting into the ground sounds like a good option to us.

Could you please provide a quote for the PS1 certification and let me know:
Your cost for the full certification
Anything else you would need from us
Any other recommendations or considerations for compliance

Feel free to give me a call tomorrow if easier to discuss.
Thanks again for your support.

# üìã Project Analysis Report

Thank you for your request regarding PS1 certification for the 15x40m double-decker marquee in Wellington. Based on our extensive experience with similar temporary structures, I can provide the following analysis:

## Our Experience with Similar Projects
We've successfully completed several comparable projects:
‚Ä¢ **Project 184**: 12x35m marquee structure in Wellington (2023) - PS1 certified
‚Ä¢ **Project 201**: 18x45m double-decker events structure in Auckland (2024)  
‚Ä¢ **Project 157**: Wind-rated marquee (120kph) at Trentham Racecourse (2022)

## Key Considerations for Your Project

### Wind Load Analysis
Your 120kph wind rating requirement is excellent and exceeds many temporary structures. Based on our experience:
- Full wind engineering analysis will be required for PS1 certification
- The double-decker configuration will need special attention for wind uplift
- We've successfully certified similar structures to 140kph+ ratings

### Foundation & Anchoring
Concrete pad installation with anchor bolts is indeed the preferred method:
- M24 galvanized anchor bolts typically required at 2m centers
- Pad thickness minimum 200mm for this scale of structure
- Pull-out testing may be required for high wind loads

### Compliance Pathway
For PS1 certification in Wellington:
- Producer Statement PS1 for Design will cover structural adequacy
- Early consultation with Wellington City Council recommended
- Wind tunnel testing may be required (we can arrange through our partners)

## Potential Challenges & Solutions
Based on past similar projects:

**Challenge**: Complex wind load calculations for double-decker configuration
**Solution**: We use advanced CFD modeling and have established calculation methods

**Challenge**: Council approval timelines for temporary structures  
**Solution**: Our established relationships ensure efficient consent processes

**Challenge**: Coordination with supplier technical data
**Solution**: We work directly with marquee suppliers to verify specifications

## What We Need to Proceed
1. **Detailed drawings** from your supplier (structural layout, connections)
2. **Site plan** showing proposed location and orientation  
3. **Foundation details** including existing concrete pad specifications
4. **Timeline requirements** for certification and installation

## Cost & Timeline Estimate
Based on similar projects:
- **PS1 Design certification**: $3,500 - $5,500 (depending on complexity)
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks from receiving complete information
- **Additional services**: Wind analysis, council liaison if required

## Risk Assessment: üü° MEDIUM
Primary considerations: Foundation adequacy verification, wind load certification for double-decker configuration

## Next Steps
1. Schedule site visit to assess existing concrete pad
2. Review supplier drawings and specifications
3. Commence wind engineering analysis  
4. Prepare PS1 documentation

We're confident in delivering this certification efficiently based on our track record with similar structures. I'll call you tomorrow as suggested to discuss details and timeline.
