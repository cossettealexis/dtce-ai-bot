## How to Test:
Use this format to test each question:
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/documents/ask?question=YOUR_QUESTION_HERE" | jq '.answer'

Or for full response with sources:
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/documents/ask?question=YOUR_QUESTION_HERE" | jq

## Expected Behaviors:
- Should find relevant documents when they exist
- Should give honest "I cannot find" answers when no relevant docs exist
- Should cite sources with blob URLs
- Should focus only on document content
- Should handle typos and variations in questions gracefully
